"Today session was Really Informative, we want more session by Krish Naik sir in upcoming days."
"If you are preparing DSA for basics, then it will be good for us if we can do the DSA assignments after completing that sessions because at this point of time I'm not understanding most of the parts of DSA and solving the assignments by taking help of google which is not much fruitful for me and also I have no other options because i'm not able to understand the topics and there is a timeline to submit the assignments."
Everything went well
"Need to have this type of session every 15 days or month to get energetic,getting booster and encourage how successful people do things differently "
More question answer could have been more helpful.

Session is Good . The mentor said job fair will be in offline mode in noida. Is Job fair available in virtual mode of interview? If it's available in Virtual mode it  will be very helpful. 
NO
Very insightful session
thank you 
This is to bring to your attention. Few people joined fsds 2.0 course late after March 2023 although course started in Sep 2022. For us the deadline to submit assignment needs to be extended please. I am fro non IT background and needs to complete watching and learning recordings from the beginning and submitting assignments by June 6th is very challenging. Kindly reconsider and allow late joiners a chance to appear for interviews.
"Hello, I am Priyanka Sett from FSDS 2022 September batch. Today's session was very nice and very helpful. The guidance provided is much required for me at least, as I have a 2 year gap and I am trying to make a transition. I have two queries. 
1. If one does not qualify for job guarantee program (as this program and the criteria were announced recently.), whether the job assistance will be provided or not. 
2.  Regarding the job fair, is it possible to appear online ? 

Thank you. 
Priyanka Sett"
"The PPT classes are compulsory to attend; however, I have been practicing DSA for over a year and a half and find it not very beneficial to watch the class or recording. If the competency could be checked by some other method such as test or  assignment rather than class recording watch time. That would be better for people like me!"
It was a good session.
The session was very informative
Please consider Bigdata 
no
I didn't understand why job fair is organised in offline mode and that too for Noida location. Sir please we have enrolled in ineuron with a hope that we can get help for job assistance and I belongs from a very poor background.Going to a different city for looking for job will be cumbersome process for us especially at this time.

There should be doubt clearance if we stuck on any problem by chat support.

Dsa overall interview overview
Teaching and Explaination is excellent. Continue the same mentor for the remaining dsa topics
iNeuron PLEASE read our feedback... PLEASE LET GLADDEN RUMAO TAKE THE REST OF THE DSA sessions for this ppt program. GLADDEN RUMAO IS THE BEST MENTOR IN THIS PPT PROGRAM SO FAR. please let him continue taking all the DSA sessions if you want us to genuinely learn anything in this ppt program. He is a a true teacher.  His way of teaching and explanations of the concepts can make even a non-tech background person interested to learn DSA. Please let Gladden take the rest of the DSA sessions.

Each and every concept is clear in a very simple way.The mentor is amzing and his teaching is excellent.
"Gladden Sir is truly amazing! I can't help but express my gratitude for his exceptional teaching and mentoring skills. Every session with him has been an absolute delight, although it always feels like they end too soon. I wish we could have more of his invaluable sessions.

As a teacher and mentor, Gladden Sir possesses a remarkable ability to simplify complex concepts. He has a unique way of explaining things that makes it easy for everyone to grasp and understand, regardless of their prior experience or knowledge. It's truly remarkable how he can make even the most daunting topics seem approachable and manageable.

Being a beginner in the field of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), I was initially intimidated by the subject. However, Gladden Sir's teaching style and dedication to his students have completely transformed my learning experience. He has broken down intricate algorithms and data structures into digestible pieces, ensuring that each concept is thoroughly understood before moving on.

 I hope that in the future, there will be more opportunities to learn from Gladden Sir and benefit from his exceptional teaching."

So plzz discuss this in one class seperate

3.ppt program has assingments and lectures but assingment numbering has derailed from matching lecture numbering
it will be good if we find link below video so that we get same ques for which video lecture is made
or numbering is made same to the video

4.Also atleast anyone language code of ques solved in class we want in resource
because i have to solve  in python but to understand and quick revisions atleast give java solutions in resource for quick view when solving assingnment"
